# cutefetch
Cute little sysinfo fetch script for use in screenshots.

A "fork" of [elenapan](https://github.com/elenapan)'s [bunnyfetch](https://github.com/elenapan/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/bunnyfetch) script.

PS: I don't know how to fork single scripts from larger repos.

### install
Copy the fetch script to somewhere on your `$PATH` and make it executable by running `chmod a+x ./cutefetch` in the directory it is located.
I use `$HOME/.local/bin/`
